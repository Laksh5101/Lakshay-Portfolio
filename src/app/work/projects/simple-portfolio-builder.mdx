## Overview

Conducted in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on structured datasets to uncover meaningful insights, identify trends, and prepare data for machine learning and decision-making.
Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and data type inconsistencies using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**: Analyzed distributions, relationships, and correlations using visualizations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new variables, categorized data, and normalized features to enhance analysis.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Utilized Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to generate charts, heatmaps, and pair plots.
- **Insight Generation**: Discovered key patterns such as user behavior, survival factors, or sales trends depending on the dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for analysis and transformation.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and statistical computation.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly**: For static and interactive data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and presenting EDA workflow and findings.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Learned to handle messy, real-world datasets and derive clean, meaningful insights.
- Gained experience in visual storytelling to communicate data patterns effectively.
- Enhanced skills in identifying features that contribute to predictive modeling.

## Outcome

- Delivered a comprehensive EDA report with actionable insights, used for further machine learning modeling or business intelligence decisions. The project strengthened data wrangling, pattern recognition, and visualization skills.
